Supermarket Checkout Simulation
Developed an object-oriented supermarket checkout system with regular and self-service lanes using Python. Implemented lane management, customer assignment, and checkout processes with inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. The simulation used threading for real-time operation, with a GUI built in Tkinter to display lane status and customer activity. The system featured lottery functionality based on customer basket sizes.
